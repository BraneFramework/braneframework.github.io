# Welcome to BraneProject

Welcome to the Brane framework

This site is split into a couple sub-sites, each with its own purpose:

[Brane: The User Guide](/user-guide) is aimed at the users of the framework. It documents how to setup a framework as an system administrator, how to write packages on BraneScript or Bakery as a software engineer and how to write workflows as a scientist. Basically, if you are using Brane as a finalized program, this is the documentation for you.

[Brane: A Specification](/specification) is the book for those who are intending to develop the framework or who want to know how it works. It documents the framework's internal workings, as well as provides a specification for how services communicate so they may be replaced by custom software running on the individual domains (hence it being a framework). In general, if you will be doing development about some part of the framework, you should start here.

[Brane Code Documentation](/brane) is the documentation for the code itself. It's not really meant to be read from top to bottom, like the other books, but rather as a reference during development on existing code.

[Policy-reasoner Documentation](/policy-reasoner) is the same, but then for the policy-reasoner project

drawing Note that the documentation is generated specifically for a Linux x86/64 build. If you are developing or running Brane on a non-Linux or non-x86_64 machine, it might make sense to generate the documentation yourself instead; check cargo doc.

As an aside, this  also hosts:

[Tutorial Materials](/brane-tutorials) contains resources for past demos, workshops and tutorials hosted for the Brane project. These are useful as they contain additional examples, slides and other materials that may further one's understanding for Brane.
