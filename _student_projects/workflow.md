We are always looking for people to do interesting work on top of Brane. In this project you will create a demonstration workflow for Brane in which you use the distributed nature of Brane to run some scientific workload. Brane was made for multiple domains to colalborate with limited sharing of data. For this project you will write a workflow, data access policy, and needed packages for Brane in order to accomplish the set scientific goal.
